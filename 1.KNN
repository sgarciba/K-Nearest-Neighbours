This project implements from scratch a K Nearest Neighbours Classifier to two datasets to predict the correspondent label given new observations. The main goal is to find the right K number that gives the best accuracy for both examples.

The first example is the Iris dataset which can be found in the sklearn package. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers and 4 features that measure the size of its sepals and petals. The final target is a categorical variable of the three possible species of iris (iris setosa, iris virginica and iris versicolor). 

The second one is the ionosphere dataset, it has been downloaded from a text file and it gives information of a radar system in Goose Bay, Labrador, using 351 samples and 34 features. If the sample shows some structure in the ionosphere, the final label will be "Good(+1)", otherwise it returns "Bad(-1)".

Both datasets are already normalised, so they do not need any pre-processing before implementing the model. However, as it is a supervised learning approach, the data has to be previously split into training and test sets. The objective is to find the best test accuracy score for every example.
